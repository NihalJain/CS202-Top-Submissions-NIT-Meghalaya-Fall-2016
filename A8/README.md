#Assignment 8 - Graphs

Given number of nodes N and an adjacency matrix Mat representing the graph. Create a directed graph using linked list using N and Mat. 

After the graph is created write a function to do Depth First Traversal of the graph from the a given source node. The program should accept source as input from the user. Print the order of traversal of nodes.

Finally, given a source and a destination node, use dfs to find whether the destination node is reachable from the source node.
